This game is a text-driven strategy game and contains graphical elements to it, even though the game is in Windows Console.

You are the king of an imaginary land, As a king you must make the right choices to keep your throne. There are three parameters; People, Court and Treasury. In order to stay in power, you must manage these three by making the right chices. Watch out! Avoid making one of the parameters reach zero and avoid making the average of the three parameters reach lower than 10!

There are 2 modes for this game; Campaign and Endless. In Campaign mode, you answer all the questions in the game three times, if you survive! if you managed to do that, it's a win for you! In Endless mode, you have to survive for as long as you can! In both modes, your score will be saved. In the campaign, it's based on the sum of the three parameters, and in endless, it's based on your age, which represents the number of questions you managed to answer.
